    <p>
        This docuement is for educational use only, unless specify asked apon, none of the pictures have been hand drawn and they all fall under common use (due to this being in an educatinal zone I am guessing).
        considering this is a website, I will not give my email*, or number, so there is no other way for you to conntact me. Other than in person, I will gladly accpet people to come in-person or through people 
        If you can't I have editors so it will most likely be resolved soon, if not, deal with it. 

        *I am not in the school any more so here is my gmail, email me if anything is wrong in the docuements thank you

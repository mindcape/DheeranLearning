    <h1 >you really have a lot in you if you wanted to come here </h1>
    <p style="color: red; font-style: italic; text-align: center;"> Ok so you came here to find out that I really like to prank people, or you are just desprate. <br> 
    Or someone told you about this web site and you want to see it. I am still not letting you see and read stuff about my dog. <br>
So if some one told you you need to see this website and gave you this URL 1:they need you to see this website, that I created in two days ( flex intended) <br>
or I would tell my friends and you know how you are. </p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;"> In simple terms GET OUT unless if you told by your friend, another thing is that you are surfing the net and did it for too long or I told you to. </p>
<h2> get out now with this <a href="last_prank_page.html">link</a></h2>

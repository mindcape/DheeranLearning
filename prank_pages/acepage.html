        <p>
            You trusted me and you came to this page, this web site took a long time <br> 
            and it is really hard to make web sites with two programing langagues. 
            If you are computer smart I am not saying you are not smart but you should have seen the <br>
            surch bar and saw the names that I put for the pages. <br>
            They are called prank pages and i pranked you hard. So this is the last page,
            trust me. I named it acepage because I am going to name one thing about my dog that is cool. Well two. <br>
            He is hyper active and has a brown strip down his back that is rough.

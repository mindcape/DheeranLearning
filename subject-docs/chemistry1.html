    <h1>Chemistry</h1>
<p>
    History of the atom is chat-gtp-ed.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions please comment and I will get to them when I feel like
    it, not when I am available, when I feel like it.. And it is very confusing.
    Look at ted-ed videos on YT you will get everything.
</p>
<h2>Stoichiometry </h2>
<p>
    (confusing youtube can specify)
</p>
<p>
    This is confusing and not the full thing and so help. All of this is bs ( i am
    confused)
</p>
<p>
    One AMU (atomic mass unit) is 1/12th the mass of the atom carbon 12 (isotope)
    and to find the moles (amount of stuff) you multiply by avagardo’s number 6.022
    *10<sup>23</sup>(this the number is C<sup>12</sup> in 12 grams) times the amu
    and you get the amount of mass (you have to do some more stuff but it is the
    gist of it and the basic idea we won’t need to know this)
</p>
<p>
    And one mole is equal to one gram and so on.
</p>
<p>
    In one mole there is 6.022*10<sup>23</sup> of that atom
</p>
<p>
    Like there one mole of pure hydrogen meaning that there is 6.022*10<sup>23</sup>
    atoms in that mole
</p>
<p>
    And one mole is equal to one gram or ml or so on.
</p>
<p>
    So there is 6.022*10<sup>23</sup> atoms in one ml of pure hydrogen (times two
    because hydrogen is a diatomic molecule)
</p>
<p>
    And you get to a mole by multiplying the amu by avagadro’s constant. So rinse
    and repeat.
</p>
<p>
    Everything simplified
</p>
<ul>
    <li>One AMU is 1/12th of a carbon atom 
    <li>One AMU is equal to one gram
    <li>To find the atoms in one gram of that element , moles * avogadro's number.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>water of crystallization</h4> 
</p>
<p>
    So essentially what water of crystallization means is that the molecule has a
    H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> in it and is either changing its property or
    surrounding it. It is often represented by a . before the H<sub>2</sub>O
    molecule symbolizing that it is surrounding the molecule and anything that
    doesn’t have it means that it is a Anhydrous salt
</p>
<p>
*This only happens in salts.
</p>
    <h2>History of the Atom.</h2>
    <p>
    (this is chat gpt I didn’t even read it when pasting it).
    </p>
    <p>
    In the 18th and 19th centuries, scientists like Dalton, Avogadro, and Lavoisier
    made significant contributions. Dalton's atomic theory in the early 1800s
    suggested that atoms were indivisible and unique to each element. Avogadro's
    hypothesis distinguished between atoms and molecules, while Lavoisier's work
    laid the groundwork for the law of conservation of mass.
    </p>
    <p>
    The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw pivotal discoveries. J.J. Thomson's
    experiments with cathode rays led to the identification of the electron, a
    subatomic particle. Rutherford's gold foil experiment demonstrated that atoms
    have a small, dense nucleus surrounded by mostly empty space. His model proposed
    a planetary structure with electrons orbiting the nucleus.
    </p>
    <p>
    Niels Bohr expanded on Rutherford's model, suggesting that electrons orbit the
    nucleus in quantized energy levels. This laid the foundation for quantum
    mechanics. Later, Schrödinger's wave equation and Heisenberg's uncertainty
    principle revolutionized atomic theory, emphasizing the probabilistic nature of
    particle behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the mid-20th century, discoveries of subatomic particles like protons,
    neutrons, and neutrinos refined the understanding of atomic structure. The
    development of quantum field theory and the Standard Model in the latter half of
    the century further deepened our understanding of particles and fundamental
    forces.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Structure of an Atom,
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Atoms have a centralized nucleolus with both protons and neutrons in the middle.
    Protons have a positive charge and neutrons have a neutral charge. The neutrons
    help keep the protons attached in a condensed sphere. Because positive and
    positive repel.
    </p>
    <p>
    Electrons, subatomic particles that have a negative charge, spin around the
    nucleus in energy shells. These shells can be thought of as orbitas, similar to
    the planets spinning around the sun. Except that electrons are not that linear
    with their orbits, as electrons move too fast for the human eye to see even with
    advanced technology. We do have a vague understanding of the layout of which
    there shells and how the electrons are distributed. Which is the base of the
    chemistry
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Periodic table
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    (<a href="#">Back to top</a>)
    style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>
    <img style="height: 500px; width: auto;"  src="ptable.png" width="" alt="periodic table" title="image_tooltip">
</p>
<p>
*This is not always going to be the exact color scheme of the periodic table due
to more complex and or less complex versions.
</p>
<p>
Red - Alkali Metals, When bonded with hydroxide (OH) they form Aliken(base)
substance.
</p>
<p>
Orange - Aliken earth metals, Same as above, but found in nature, naturally and
exhibit similar properties of the Aliken metals, in the rules of bonding.
</p>
<p>
Green and pink - they are all non metals,
</p>
<p>
	Green, These are all nonmetals, and react in about the same way, taking
electrons or sharing. (see, bonds)
</p>
<p>
Group 17, These are ones next to the pink group. These elements are called
halogens and are very reactive. They often form salts. Their name’s suffix is
called salt forming, you could say it is in the name.
</p>
<p>
Pink - These are the noble gasses, These like Nobles, don’t like to combine, and
thus are not very reactive, they do react even with a full valence shell, They
still react.
</p>
<p>
	Yellow- metalloids, brittle and malleable metals, they are like Ragavan, very
very malleable and like Ruthivk, brittle.
</p>
<p>
The middle part is Transition metals, those are weird, I am not going into that.
(couple weeks later) Well now I am because of how bored I am with the class. -
but u didn't write it yet
</p>
<p>
Valency :ampersand: electron configuration
</p>
<p>
Electron config. - how electrons are arranged in their respective energy shells.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrons follow a particular configuration when they bond with a nucleus,
They always fill the first shell in then move on to the next shell (in relation
to Aliken metals, and earth metals, along with non metals, metalloids)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
*This is what we need to know for this year, for future reference is best to
know this is not true for everything but the first shell, and it depends on the
elements, for how the shells get filled and the sub shells because electrons are
flowing around in a non-coercive orbit and it is often not planetary and we can
only attempt to predict where it will go.
</p>
<ul>
<li>They often go up in 8ts
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is the configuration for the first 20 elements
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 2,8,18,2
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As one is filled up the next is taken, and the number of electrons directly
correlates to the amount of protons. (again, in relation to the groups stated
above)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Eg - oxygen has a configuration of 2,6 : calcium has a config. Of 2,8,8,2 : etc
</p>
<ul>
<li>The period determines how many shells, or obitals the element has.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Eg - oxygen has 2 levels, and Calcium has 4 etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The group decides on how many valence electrons it has, which has a direct
correlation to the reactivity of the element.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
*this is all fun and games for the first 20 elements and we haven’t even touched
intermediate there are subshells which change everything we know about
reactivity, as that introduces the practicality of oxidation as well as offers
us a better picture of how they bond, this is all based of Bhor’s model.
</p>
<p>
Valency - The number of electrons in the outermost shells.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The group number tells how many valence electrons for all the elements aside
from the human made, and Transition metals. So groups 1,2,13,14,15,16,17,18.
<li>Group one has one valence electron, Group two has two valence electrons, and
from group 13, you have to drop the ten so, in group 13 there are only 3 valence
electrons and for 14 you drop the ten so there are only 4 valence electrons. And
so on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
*side note. The only reason we don’t include the transition metals and human
made metals is that their valence and electron configuration get annoying and
weird. As they have the tendency to do some wacky stuff. * when I do get
information on these It will be in its only section.
</p>
<p>
Atomic Radius
</p>
<ul>
<li>The distance from the nucleus to the valence shells, thus changed the size
of the atom
<li>
<li>The atomic radius increases the lower you go in the periodic table, meaning
that the more shells that an atom has the bigger its atomic Radius.
<ul>
<li>So in the Alkali metals, Francium is the biggest element. (F	r man)
</li>
</ul>
<li>The bigger that atom is, the more reactive it is. This is due to the fact
that the farther away you go from the center of mass the less pull you have, and
it is easier for other atoms to take you away that have a stronger nucleic
force.
</li>
</ul>
<h2> (James) Bonding</h2>
<ul>
<li>Covalent bond - mutual sharing of the electrons often between one non-metal,
and nonmetals
<ul>
<li>Anything lower than >0.4 is considered non-polar and just a covalent bond
<li>Polar covalent bonds
<ul>
<li>If it the electronegativity difference is 0.4<x> 1.8 then it is considered a
polar covalent bond and anything higher than 1.8 is considered ionic <strong>in
nature </strong>(remember that in nature, they still share the electron but not
fairly, kinda like how Ruthvik steals aneesh’s charger at this point it's
Ruthvik but it is technically still Aneesh. Here the charger is the electron and
the two other <em>humans </em>are the elements)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
How covalent bonds are presented
</p>
<p>
Each paired electron is represented by a hyphen (-) up to a max of three shared
electrons (that is the max amount of bonds observed.
</p>
<p>
    (<a href="#">Back to top</a>)
<img src="covalent bonds.png" width="" alt="covalent bond examples" title="image_tooltip">
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ionic bond - giving of the electrons of the electrons. Often between metals
and nonmetals
<ul>
<li>They share the electrons, they are so polar that they essentially give the
electron but because the atoms are mostly solids they are held together
</li>
</ul>
<li>This is how it is represented: the one that is giving the electron is
represented by a + and the one that is receiving the electron has a -. If there
is multiple amounts of electrons transferred then there is the number of
electron transferred then the sign + or - like 2- if receiving 2 electrons thus
gaining a negative charge, and the one losing gets a positive charge like 2+
(there can be multiple atoms giving to one atom or one atom giving or bonding to
many)

Polar covalent bond
</p>
<ul>
<li>A polar covalent bond means that the atoms are not both sharing the same
amount of electrons. *correction, they are sharing the same about they one of
the atoms is pulling the shared electrons closer to itself thus resulting in a
polar covalent bond.

*important*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dipoles occur when electrons are shared unequally between atoms in the same
molecule due to a high difference in the electronegativity of the atoms
involved. A dipole is a molecule or covalent bond that has a separation of
charges.
<li>This happens in polar covalent bonds
</li>
</ul>
<p>
*Another important note, this stuff is still advanced for the 9th as I do not
think this is coming in our exams, but it is still good to remember as this is
the base for Chemistry, along with almost everything in this document. (no it is
not, we learned it, it is there latter look at that it is clearer for the most
part)
</p>
<p>
Pauling scale
</p>
<p>
The range of values for Pauling's scale of electronegativity ranges from
Fluorine (most electronegative = 4.0) to Francium (least electronegative = 0.7)
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above
</p>
<p>
>0.4 = considered to be non-polar in nature.
</p>
<p>
0.4 - 1.8 = considered to be polar
</p>
<p>
1.8 = considered to ionic in nature
</p>
<h2>Compounds - </h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
*We need to remember these, as they are important. Read this before the bonding
section. It becomes easier, no I am not swapping them both.
</p>
<p>
Sulfate - SO<sub>4<sup>2-</sup></sub>
</p>
<p>
Sulfite  - SO<sub>3<sup>2-</sup></sub>
</p>
<p>
Phosphite - PO<sub>4<sup>3-</sup></sub>
</p>
<p>
Phosphate - PO<sub>3<sup>3-</sup></sub>
</p>
<p>
Carbonate - CO<sub>3<sup>2- </sup></sub>
</p>
<p>
Nitrate  - NO<sub>3<sup>1-	</sup></sub>
</p>
<p>
Ammonium - NH<sub>4<sup>1+</sup></sub>
</p>
<p>
Hydroxide - OH<sup>1-</sup>
</p>
<p>
Bonding - pain.
</p>
<p>
Write element name.
</p>
<p>
Write down their, atomic symbol
</p>
<p>
Eg: Mg, Al, S, Ca etc.
</p>
<p>
Then write their charges, then cross multiply their chargers. For simple bonds,
for more complex ones that need to be on paper to properly,
</p>
<p>
That should be the last step if you are lucky. If you are not, (which for most
will not be) then you have to have to balance the equation.
</p>
<h2>Separation techniques </h2>
<p>
I got time now, so I do (2/23/34) 8:30pm
</p>
<ol>
<li>Electrolysis
</li>
</ol>
<p>
*you need this for the final unit.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the process of which we split the dissolved ions by passing electric
shock through them, using a simple cell, aka, a cathode (-) and anode (+), then
apply the magnetism rules and there you go.  There are some rules for what is
discharged (what goes to each -ode)
<ul>
<li>For the anode
<ul>
<li>Halogens will be discharged over anything
<li>SO<sub>4<sup>-2 </sup></sub> will always stay back.
</li>
</ul>
<li>For the cathode
<ul>
<li>Metals below hydrogen in the reactivity series(with a considerable distance)
hydrogen will be released, and the other thing will stay.
</li>
</ul>
<li>A common rule is that the concentration has to be taken into account, the
higher the concentration of something the higher chance that will be discharged.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Filtration
<li>Take a filter, and filter it through, I don’t understand how hard it can be.
<ul>
<li>Stuff that is big(macromolecules) will stay filtered and the rest will come
out.
<li>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Balancing - </h2>
<p>
Law of conservation of mass is the pain that has to be addressed here.
</p>
<p>
Due to the law of conservation of mass we have to make sure we are not violating
that.
</p>
<p>
In order to balance an equation we can only add coefficients and no other sub or
superscripts.
</p>
<p>
Coefficients mean you multiply the entire equation’s subscripts by that number,
you can add it to any side but each side of the equation has to be balanced
</p>
<p>
Eg: H<sub>2</sub>+ O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2 </sub> is the
unbalanced formula ( this may not be a real reaction, It is just an example)
2H<sub>2</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
 *you can’t multiply by one, that does not exist or can you multiply by a
fraction or decimal. What we are doing here is adding another atom that makes
the entire number of that compound or element increase. In the example we had
only one water molecule, and when we added a two next to it, it became two water
molecules part took in the experiment, to create that reaction.
</p>
<p>
(NO)<sub>3 </sub>- this means that there is three N<sub>3</sub> and there is
O<sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>
*you have to practice this a lot to properly master it because of how confusing
it gets once it gets out of the range of basic equations.
</p>
<h2>Radioactivity - </h2>

</p>
<p>
*confusing
</p>
<p>
*it's simple because it is straightforward if I do miss anything please tell me
that I did, aka (comment)
</p>
<p>
There are three types of radiation
</p>
<ul>
<li>      half-life is the length of time it takes for half of the radioactive
atoms in a group of radioactive isotopes to decay, so about half their life.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Alpha
</p>
<p>
Alpha radiation releases what essentially is helium nucleus form the nucleus
</p>
<p>
It can’t even pass through a paper so it isn’t that harmful, but it is a helium
nucleus that is released.
</p>
<p>
Sa re Gamma
</p>
<p>
Gamma radiation is just energy and is released from the nucleus and is pure
energy.
</p>
<p>
Beta (get ma remote)
</p>
<p>
Beta radiation is a loss of a negative charge, often from a neutron splitting
apart to form a proton.
</p>
<h2>Giant covalent structures (crystal bonds) Macromolecular bonding  </h2>
<p>
Want to add a small note here, metals also follow a similar structure called
crystal, they follow the same thing but have delocalised electrons as that is
what makes it tough as they share all the free electrons to bond with the same
element. The delocalization of the electrons is the reason why it conducts
current.
</p>
<p>
This is also the reason why impurities weaken the metal and that is why pure
metals are very strong.
</p>
<p>
Allotropes are defined as the different physical forms of the same element with
the same temperature and pressure and atoms combine in different ways.
</p>
<p>
(lots of names, anything that means big structure is usually meaning, a repeated
set of bonds that are held together, and are repeating till the end of the
material.)
</p>
<p>
*This is only applicable to covalent structures because polarity is only
possible here.
</p>
<p>
 Giant lattice structures are structures that have a continuous repeating bond
that is so big that it is considered Giant. And is often forming a lattice, and
is a structure hence its name. This is often found in crystals, but is not
limited only to crystals, as many metals, metalloids and sometimes gasses (I
think) form crystal bonds that are not always ridged as you may think.
</p>
<p>
(ok so this may, and is, confusing don’t worry, just search it up and you will
be fine, I don’t feel 	like it)
</p>
<p>
So there are two things that we need to know for examples, which are allotropes
for carbon
</p>
<ul>
<li>One is diamond
<li>One is graphite
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Diamond
</p>
<p>
Diamond is a crystal that is forged through coal going through high high
temperatures along with lots and lots of pressure. This results in the strongest
covalent bond on earth. This is through a 3d bond, which is ever repeating till
the end of the crystal.
</p>
<p>
Tetrahedral bond (I think that is how you spell that)
</p>
<p>
Each carbon atom is connected to four other carbon atoms one on top and three at
the bottom.
</p>
<p>
Look at figure (A)
</p>
<p>
Making all of the electrons not delocalized, meaning that there are no free
flowing electrons resulting in little no space between the two bonds as well
</p>
<p>
as not being able to conduct electricity.
</p>
<p>
The bonds are very hard to break making the melting (sublimation) point high.

<p>
 Figure B on the other hand shows a bond like sheets.
</p>
<p>
This is the second one that we need to know. Graphite.
</p>
<p>
Graphite bonds are only connected to three other carbon atoms at any given
point, and are layered in sheets. The bonds are still strong but due to it being
in sheets it has one free electron per ion, and it is flowing around making it
able to conduct electricity meaning that the electron is delocalized, also do to
it be layers they can slip and slide making it less structurally sound (this
means a 2d bond, and allows for it to be in pencils.
</p>
<p>
But due to it being a covalent bond it is very hard to melt (sublime) but its 2D
structure allows for the graphite to slip between each other, this makes it a
good lubricant.
</p>
<h2>Intermolecular forces</h2>
<p>
The only thing you need to remember here is magnetism, like repels like and
opposites attract.
</p>
<p>
Remember polarity, if not look at Types of bonds Bonds again because that is the
basis of two out of three different things in intermolecular forces.
</p>
<p>
But what do we mean by intermolecular forces, it is the force between one
molecule of one substance to another molecule of another substance, not
intramolecular forces that means inside of the same molecule. Taking the example
of Cl<sub>2</sub> if we talk about the electrons, and han
</p>
<p>
Now the two atoms are pulling at each other, which is an intramolecular force.
If we talk about how Cl<sub>2</sub> behaves with other gasses that are
intermolecular forces.
</p>
<p>
*side note, Cl<sub>2</sub> is not that good at affecting other compounds or
molecules in its gaseous states.
</p>
<p>
So expect that you have a clear understanding of those two very different
terminologies.
</p>
<p>
So there are three different forces we have to know.
</p>
<p>
Dipole - Dipole bond
</p>
<p>
Dispersion
</p>
<p>
Hydrogen bonds
</p>
<p>
Dipole bonds are when there is a polarity in the bond and drawing on our
knowledge of what magnets are we can see the resemblance. (don’t remember what
polarity is, it is in the Types of Bonds section) Then each side will draw the
opposite charges of different molecules  to corresponding sides and will either
change(break) the bond of one of the polar bonds and they will react and or with
molecules that aren’t polar could possibly start a Dispersion force, where the
all or a majority of electrons of one side of an atom  are moved to one side
give a temporary positive side of the atom and a temporary negative to one side
this can attract and or push it self away or together depending on the charge
temporary  that is facing the area as well as what the other compound, element,
and or atom’s temporary charges are.
</p>
<p>
Hydrogen bonds are just Dipole - Dipole bonds but they are just the extreme
where there has to be hydrogen and a highly electronegative element that makes
it so polar that it can almost dissolve anything like water. That is a hydrogen
bond and is a great example of both dipole dipole and hydrogen bonding.
</p>
<p>
Dipole - Dipole reaction example
</p>
<ul>
<li>You mix salt with water and the salt dissolves. This is due to the polarity
of the water and the salt. Salt (NaCl) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) are both polar
meaning that that criteria is met, (and is the only criteria to be met). Water
and salt are both polar covalent bonds, this results in the positive end of
water (H) to pull against the negative end of the (NaCl idk what element is
negative and what is positive here) and pulls on it and the positive end of
water (O) pull on the negative end of salt breaking the salt bond, because water
has more difference in the polarity then the salt meaning that the positive and
negative sides are stronger because O is a very electronegative element and
pulls the electrons closer and closer towards itself and the H un able to do
anything becomes even one positively charged. At this point I am describing
polarity. Go read it for yourself.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Dispersion force example
</p>
<p>
In the atom itself the electrons are pushed to one side or another and there is
a temporary positive end and a temporary negative end created in the electron
shells and this creates a ripple effect. Pushing the electrons of another atom
and so forth. And meaning that the
</p>
<p>
I am not sure but this could be the reason for static electricity and temporary
charges, because all the electrons are moved to one side and have a temporary
negative charge across all atoms.
</p>
<p>
*Idk of one specifically but I do know that it is so weak that it is only
noticeably in solids and some very dense liquids so essentially the molecules
have to be very close to each other, for dispersion to take place.
</p>
<p>
Hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
The dipole - dipole is also a hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
And it has to be a dipole - dipole reaction.
</p>
<p>
The criteria are that it has to have hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
As well as it has to have a very electronegative element.
</p>
<h2>Redox reaction-(kinda organic chem) </h2>
<p>
Redox reactions are a combination of two different things
</p>
<p>
Oxidation reactions and reduction
</p>
<p>
Oxidation is when an ion loses electrons
</p>
<p>
Reduction is when an ion gains electrons
</p>
<p>
*in chemistry naming is weird, you just have to memorize you can use something
called
</p>
<p>
OIL RIG
</p>
<p>
O- oxidation
</p>
<p>
I- is
</p>
<p>
L - loss of electrons
</p>
<p>
R - reduction
</p>
<p>
I- is
</p>
<p>
G- gain of electrons
</p>
<p>
Note the use of “an ion” meaning that inorder for this to happen there needs to
be two atoms reacting, thus meaning that there is always one ion being oxidized
and one ion being reduced.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
If you remember from    last year,
</p>
<p>
Combination - combining of two atoms
</p>
<p>
Decomposition - two atoms decomposing into to two different atoms
</p>
<p>
Single replacement - where the more reactive element displaces the less reactive
one
</p>
<p>
Double replacement  - where there is more than one atom displaced
</p>
<p>
Combustion  - this reaction includes the exchange of oxygen often in the
presence of fire or heat ( some type of heat is needed)
</p>
<p>
*New
</p>
<p>
Disproportion reactions -  is a redox reaction in which one compound of
intermediate oxidation state converts to two compounds, one of higher and one of
lower oxidation states
</p>
<h2>Oxidation states </h2>
<p>
OIL RIG is the only thing you need to know to do this, as well as 5th grade
level algebra and a 3rd grade level of common sense.
</p>
<p>
The oxidation state of an element is how many electrons it has lost or gained,
and we can tell its oxidation state by calculating it using the above mentioned
skills.
</p>
<ol>
<li>There are some rules to finding out the oxidation state of an element in a
compound(I interchange compound and ion here)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Oxidation state of an uncombined state and its oxidation state will be zero.
(when I mean uncombined it means uncombined with any other element, giant
lattice structures where there is only one element interacting with that of its
own species will still follow this rule; the same goes with any polyatomic ion.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in an ion is equal to the
charge in the ion.
<ol>
<li>So for example there is CrCl<sub>3</sub> (the charge is 0 if there is no
number on the subscript at the end of the Ion)
<li>We take the charge of Cl which is always -1 (there are some constants that
we need to memorize, but the periodic table is there for us, as I will explain
that stuff later in its own area) and we write an equation. Using our common
sense
<ol>
<li>Cr = N (unknown) Cl = -1 (and there is 3 of the Cl so we need to multiply
the -1 by 3 because there is three atoms)
<li>So the equation will be N+3(-1) = 0 (0 being the total charge)
<li>n=3 due to algebra.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here are some common oxidizing and reducing agents, and there are a bit more but
just remember these.

<h2>Ionic equations</h2>
<p>
This stuff is where we use math.
</p>
<p>
In ionic equations we only look at the atoms that go through REDOX.
</p>
<p>
This is really easy.
</p>
<p>
There are three things in the Ionic equations
</p>
<p>
An atom that goes through reduction, one that goes through oxidation, and one
that stays the same. These are called spectator ions
</p>
<p>
These are the steps for writing ionic equations
</p>
<ul>
<li>Write the balanced symbol equation​
<p>
    -Identify the soluble compounds using the solubility rules or the aqueous
state symbol​
</p>
<p>
    -Split up the soluble compounds into ions​ (by soluble I mean the ions that
are dissolved in water and it will have the symbol of (aq) in the subscript next
to the Ion)
</p>
<p>
    -Cancel ions that appear on both sides of the equation​ ( these are the
spectator ions)
</p>
<p>
    - Write out the resulting ionic equation ( that will have the oxidation of
the ions as well as the reduction of the ions
</p>

<h3><strong>Application of redox, oxidation states, and ionic equations.
</strong></h3>
<p>
(heading two because not that important.
</p>
<p>
*This is going to be all the random, zinc separation, and metal stuff, as well
as separation techniques I will not type because they should be common knowledge
at this point.
</p>
<h4><strong>Zinc extraction from Zinc Blende (ZnS)</strong></h4>
<p>
Zinc is a metal, one that is placed in the middle-high section in the reactivity
series, zinc is not found pure so people found ways to extract it into its pure
form,pure zinc is utilized for many purposes, such as paint or in batteries.
</p>
<p>
So one way is to roasting zinc, or more specifically ZnS, along with air
(O<sub>2</sub>) to create.
</p>
<p>
ZnO + SO
</p>
<p>
In the equation of ZnS + O<sub>2</sub> → ZnO + SO
</p>
<p>
(that equation is fun to write)
</p>
<p>
Then we put it in water and perform electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
Splitting it into, there respective ions (sounds like ionic equations to me,
although H<sub>2</sub>O also gets split even though it is a liquid this is due
to the electricity's high force.
</p>
<h4><strong>Iron extraction </strong></h4>
<p>
*Iron extraction is weird, because of the immense amount of waste produced being
some of the most volatile things in the world, also because a blast furnace is
annoying to understand.
</p>
<p>
Iron ore is extracted from the ground, mining come, or by recycling scrap iron
(this allows for the proper use of the iron that is essentially waste product,
and goes though the same process)
</p>
<p>
Iron we do this to remove the iron from its impurities (if you look at metallic
bonding I have gone over it, and why it is bad for the structural stability of
the iron). Some of the common impurities that are present in iron are Si,P, S,
C.
</p>
<p>
If it comes out as ore, it is partially refined then sent to the factory to be
purified in bulk.
</p>
<p>
The blast furnace is what we learned, that is all we learned, that is all I am
going to type.
</p>
<p>
*chat gpted I feel lazy I also don’t know how to explain it (i mean that if I do
then it is going to be very bad)
</p>
<p>
Charging: Iron ore, coke (a form of coal), and limestone are loaded into the top
of the furnace. The coke serves as both a fuel and a reducing agent, meaning it
helps to remove oxygen from the iron ore, reducing it to iron.
</p>
<p>
CO + F<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> → Fe + CO<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
Heating: Air is blown into the bottom of the furnace at high pressure using a
hot blast stove or other means. The air reacts with the coke to produce carbon
monoxide, which then reacts with the iron ore to form iron oxide (Fe2O3) and
carbon dioxide.
</p>
<p>
CO<sub>2</sub> + C → CO
</p>
<p>
Reduction: The carbon monoxide produced in the previous step reduces the iron
oxide to molten iron, which collects at the bottom of the furnace. The limestone
acts as a flux, combining with impurities in the iron ore to form slag, which
floats on top of the molten iron and is periodically tapped off.
</p>
<p>
C + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
Tapping: Periodically, the molten iron and slag are tapped off from the bottom
of the furnace. The molten iron is then cast into molds to form pig iron, which
can be further refined into steel.
</p>
<p>
*slag refers to what every byproduct is created during this process.
</p>
<p>
Cooling and Processing: The pig iron is cooled and further processed depending
on its intended use. It may be further refined in a basic oxygen furnace or an
electric arc furnace to produce steel with specific properties.

<h4><strong>Extraction of aluminum. </strong></h4>
<p>
There are three main ores that have Aluminum in them. Bauxite, corundum, and
cryolite.
</p>
<p>
The only ones that we care about is Bauxite due to its high concentration of Al
and cryolite for reasons we will see later.
</p>
<p>
The method that we use is electrolysis to separate the aluminum for the other
impurities, although there is a small problem, it doesn't dissolve in water, and
doesn't conduct electricity because it is an ionic compound.
</p>
<p>
We then melt it, so it both conducts electricity, and electrolysis happens.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that it is expensive to heat Al for that long so they add
cryolite, this reduces the temperature needed for it to melt (because it is an
impurity for the metal), and allows for money to be saved, and money saved is
money made, then they electrolize the thing in water, which separates the Al
form whatever impurities are present in it.

<p>
The Rods are anodes and the entire container is a cathode, this allows for the
Al to sink and create a layer of pure aluminum which is taped for the bottom.
</p>
<h4>Electroplating </h4>
<p>
Electroplating is the process in which we use electricity (modify the
electrolysis procedure) to plate an object in a different metal regardless of
the metal's reactivity
</p>
<p>
Electroplating in its essence is making the metal object the cathode and sending
electricity through it with the anode of the metal you want to coat it with.
This coats the object in that metal and as that metal is being taken out of the
liquid the metal anode that is of the same metal replenishes the liquid.
</p>
<p>
We saw with copper plating, as the liquid’s copper is used up so is the copper
rod, and we saw the plating on the stainless steel.
</p>
<h2>Electrochemical cell</h2>
<p>
Electrochemical cells produce an electric current by using a chemical reaction
(electrolysis manipulation of the set up).
</p>
<p>
*so this gets pretty confusing, forget what oxidation and reduction means for a
second, then think about the explanation.
</p>
<p>
So an electrochemical cell is a battery that uses the electricity that is
produced in an electrolysis process to generate current. This is done by the set
up below.

The salt bridge in the middle is filled with salt to finish the circuit allowing
for the electrons from the salt bridge to flow into the Zn tank. The Zn is
broken apart into Zn<sup>2+ </sup>ions which gain electrons then send the excess
electrons into the anode (as oxidation takes place) here it is negative, not
positive, Copper turns into Cu and attaches to the rod. Then there is a flow of
electrons.

<h2>Rusting (corrosion) </h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Basic overview of Corrosion of metals.
</p>
<p>
Rusting is the process by which iron (fe) corrodes into its original state (how
it is present in nature) as Fe (III) O<sub>2</sub>. Iron rusts when it comes in
contact with oxygen and water vapor.
</p>
<p>
When Iron is extracted its lattice arrangement is disturbed, and the Fe<sup>2+
</sup>ions can bond. Often with the Oxygen in the air, this creates an Anode
like effect at the area where the disturbance is at. Then the entire other part
of the Oxygen becomes the Cathode, this is important because it shows how to
protect our stuff, that is made out of iron. (under neutral conditions or
alkaline conditions)
</p>
<p>
When there are acidic conditions there is liberation of Hydrogen at anode but
rust still forms like normal.
</p>
<p>
The redox equation for rust is.
</p>
<p>
Fe<sup>2+ </sup> + OH<sup> - </sup>→ Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>
There are two (main) chemical reactions that take place at the cathode
</p>
<ul>
<li>(re)electroplating of iron
<li>Iron combining with oxygen to make ferrous oxide
</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
There are three main ways
</p>
<p>
Painting - painting is just painting the metal, if the metal is painted or
tightly covered there is no place for the water, oxygen or for it to be exposed
to anything and get corroded.
</p>
<p>
Cathodic protection - there are two different types
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sacrificial anode protection
<ul>
<li>Where you take an anode (of a more reactive element) and stick it to the
metal it is getting reacted to.
</li>
</ul>
<li>ICCP
<ul>
<li>It is essentially constant (re)electroplating at the metal cathode making it
an anode by passing current through it, this resulting in the iron that has just
released its electrons to be automatically replaced and it to stick back to the
overall metal again, and a sacrificial anode is still used here, but the
electricity is there to kick start the process.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Anodic protection
</p>
<ul>
<li>Anodic protection prevents metal corrosion by making it the positive
electrode and applying an external current to inhibit the corrosion reaction.
It's commonly used in industries to protect metal surfaces from corrosion.

Then electrons are forced into the bottom by the paste because it does not allow
the electricity to conduct into the anode directly, thus making it take the long
route through the wire, creating current, the equations are annoying so look at
the ppts, till I write them here.
</p>
<p>
In 1886, Carl Gassner obtained a German patent (No. 37,758) on a variant of the
(wet) Leclanché cell, which came to be known as the dry cell because it did not
have a free liquid electrolyte. Instead, the ammonium chloride was mixed with
Plaster of Paris to create a paste, with a small amount of zinc chloride added
in to extend the shelf life. The manganese dioxide cathode was dipped in this
paste, and both were sealed in a zinc shell, which also acts as the anode. In
November 1887, he obtained a U.S. patent 373,064 for the same device. A
dry-battery was invented in Japan during the Meiji Era in 1887. The inventor was
Sakizō Yai. However, Yai didn't have enough money to file the patent, the first
patent holder of a battery in Japan was not Yai, but Takahashi Ichisaburo.
Wilhelm Hellesen also invented a dry-battery in 1887 and obtained U.S. patent
439,151 in 1890.
</p>
<p>
A dry cell uses a paste electrolyte, with only enough moisture to allow current
to flow. Unlike a wet cell, a dry cell can operate in any orientation without
spilling, as it contains no free liquid, making it suitable for portable
equipment. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass
containers with lead rods hanging from the open top and needed careful handling
to avoid spillage. Lead–acid batteries did not achieve the safety and
portability of the dry cell until the development of the gel battery. Wet cells
have continued to be used for high-drain applications, such as starting internal
combustion engines, because inhibiting the electrolyte flow tends to reduce the
current capability.
</p>
<p>
A common dry cell is the zinc–carbon cell, sometimes called the dry Leclanché
cell, with a nominal voltage of 1.5 volts, the same as the alkaline cell (since
both use the same zinc–manganese dioxide combination).
</p>
<p>
A standard dry cell comprises a zinc anode, usually in the form of a cylindrical
pot, with a carbon cathode in the form of a central rod. The electrolyte is
ammonium chloride in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode. The remaining
space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste
consisting of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide, the latter acting as a
depolariser. In some designs, often marketed as "heavy duty", the ammonium
chloride is replaced with zinc chloride.

<h2>  Factors affecting the rate of reaction.</h2>
<p>
*you should have learned this, just a recap nothing else (if anyone takes this
out they will get removed)
</p>
<p>
So anything that can alter the amount of collisions that take place in the
reaction with the right activation energy can be considered a factor.
</p>
<p>
Some examples are
</p>
<ul>
<li>surface area
<li>Concentration of the reactants
<li>Temperature (KE)
<li>Presence  of a catalyst
<li>Pressure (in case the reactants are gasses)
</li>
</ul>
<h2>le chatelier's. </h2>
<h3>ex : Haber’s process</h3>
<p>
Haber’s process consists of the creation of ammonia.
</p>
<p>
N<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> ⇌ 2NH<sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>
The ⇌ symbol represents a dynamic equilibrium, as soon as the reaction takes
place the reaction reverses, aka whatever takes place the reaction will be
reversed the reaction will act in the other way of the wanted reaction.
</p>
<p>
This principle can be used as a guiding principle to understand the shift of the
equilibrium position to the systems at equilibrium.
</p>
<p>
The effect of Pressure (everything must be in the gaseous state), the
concentration (Number of moles) , Temperature (Kelvin)
</p>
<p>
Any change in the factors concerning a system at equilibrium is negated by a
shift of the equilibrium position in the direction which opposes the change.
</p>
<p>
This is the base of the le chatelier's process as the reaction takes place it
reverses itself and if we alter the temperature it will go against it, same as
for any type of external stimuli
</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature
<ul>
<li>Ex: in the haber's process to the left is endothermic and to the right is
exothermic so as the temp increases it leans more to the endothermic and as the
temp decreases it goes more to exothermic to remain in equilibrium.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<li>
<li>Pressure (only is applied if all the reactants and products are in the
gaseous state as that is the only state that can be compress to a notable
degree)
<ul>
<li>Same thing as concentration, just use your logic.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Concentration (depends on moles)
<ul>
<li> When the concentration is increased, it reacts in a way to decrease the
concentration of the reactants, or the product
<ul>
<li>Ex: the haber's process there is 4 reactants and 2 products so when the
reactants are increase the they react more to keep equilibrium

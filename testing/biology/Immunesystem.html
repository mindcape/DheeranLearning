                <dl>There are three lines of defense  
                    <dt>First line </dt>
                    <dd>The skin and the physical barriers like skin, mucus, tears can also be considered as the first line, another thing</dd>
                    <dd>They hold out most of the time against anything but they do get through because of our stupidness (cuts,and eating random stuff from the floor)</dd>
                    <dd>It is non-specific and will block anything that tries to enter</dd>
                    <dt>Second line </dt>
                    <dd>These include phagocytes </dd>
                    <dd>Macrophages also are part of the second line of defense; these are reused neutrophils and don’t die after one pathogen, they target anything with an antigen. </dd>
                    <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8907910/">*more information about Macrophages</a>
                    <dd>Neutrophils are also in this they engulf the foreign body and they kill it, killing it in its process.</dd>
                    <dd>When they digest the pathogen present the pathogen’s antigen on its MHC, say that there is a pathogen alerting every other WBC around. </dd>
                    <dd>Natural killer cells are also part of this as they read if the MHC complex is different and then spike the cell with a protein causing it to perform apoptosis, they attack infected and diseased cells (like cancer) </dd>
                    <dd>*An antigen is a part of a pathogen that is present on the pathogen or in the bloodstream and activates the third line of defense and alerts the second line of defense. 
*MHC (major histamine complex) it is a protein that is like a code that code is specific for us and our nucleic cells (all cells that have a nucleus) and if they are not being produced, not producing the right one, or have presented an antigen on its MHC then it is considered for digestion. </dd>
                    <dt>Third line</dt>
                    <dd>These include lymphocytes </dd>
                    <dd>B lymphocytes when they come across an antigen that binds with one of their membrane bound antibodies they start to mass produce into two types of cells B effector cell and a small percentage of B memory cells which allow for the saving of the antibody against that specific antigen (thus against that pathogen). Effector B cells produce antibodies into the bloodstream free flowing and then mark and block the specific pathogen. </dd>
                    <dd>T lymphocytes (T cells) destroy the body's own cells that have themselves been taken over by viruses or become cancerous, they know this because the cell presents faulty MHC or an antigen on its MHC, it then digests the cell and triggers a response. </dd>

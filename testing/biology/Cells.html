        <h2>Cell types</h2>
        <p class="bodycontent-paragraph">
            Prokaryotes - primitive cells that have an undeveloped nucleus, cell membrane, plasmids ( which is extra genetic material), free floating ribosomes,
            they also a protective covering called a capsule ( can be thought of as a cell wall *NOT EXACTLY  a cell wall kinda like a cell wall, although sometimes they do have cell walls) 
        </p>
        <p class="bodycontent-paragraph">
            Eukaryotes - well developed and often multicellular, they have a wide range of membrane bound organelles, such as, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, nucleus, lysosomes, centrosomes, golgi body
            (apparatus), vacuoles , plastids/chloroplasts(only present in plant cells), cell membrane(also called plasma membrane), cytoplasm and cell wall (only found in plant cells)

            Cell membrane - 
                <ul>Is one part 
                    <li>Selectively permeable, which means it decides what goes in and out. </li>
                    <li>Made up of proteins and lipids (lipids are what allow it to be selectively permeable)</li>
                    <li>Give the cell structure and shape. </li>
                    <li>First line of defense for a cell </li>

            Cytoplasm - A jelly like substance that fills the cell, it is made up of water, salts and organic molecules, it is the site of many cellular processes such as glycolysis, 
            it also helps in the movement of organelles within the cell
